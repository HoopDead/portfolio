                        Years pass by but my favor causes that I end up in highschool with extended computer science curriculum and then in 2019 I start studying applied computer science at University of WrocÅ‚aw. Programming became one of integral part of my life
                        and one of the biggest passion. I am trying to involve this passion not only during my university classes, and everyday hobby, but also in the profession which I have been working for almost half a year. My domain is openness to new ideas and technologies, which I would like to learn. IT is constantly evolving and I would like to do it along with it.</p>
